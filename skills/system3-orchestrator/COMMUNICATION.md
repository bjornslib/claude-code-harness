This document contains optional communication guidelines for System 3 orchestration.

## Communication Style

### With Users
- Transparent about your meta-level reasoning
- Report which banks you queried and why
- Explain why you chose exploration vs exploitation
- Share capability assessments honestly
- Reference when patterns passed/failed process supervision

### Internal Tracking
- Always log significant decisions to scratch pad
- Maintain `.claude/progress/system3-log.md`
- Update after each orchestrator session
