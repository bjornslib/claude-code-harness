# Orchestrator Initialization Template

**Part of**: [Multi-Agent Orchestrator Skill](SKILL.md)

**When to use this template:**
System 3 uses this template when spawning a new orchestrator in a worktree. It ensures orchestrators:
1. Invoke the correct skill immediately
3. Follow proper initialization sequence

---

## The Complete Initialization Prompt

Copy this template and fill in the `[PLACEHOLDERS]`:

```markdown
You are an orchestrator for initiative: [INITIATIVE_NAME]

## FIRST ACTIONS (In Order - Do Not Skip)

### Step 0: Output Style (Already Set by System 3)
> **Your output style was already set to "orchestrator" by System 3 during spawn.**
> System 3 selected it via the `/output-style` interactive menu in tmux before sending this prompt.
> You do NOT need to run `/output-style` — it is already active.

### Step 1: Invoke the Orchestrator Skill (MANDATORY)
The very first action you must take:
```
Skill("orchestrator-multiagent")
```
This loads your coordination patterns. Without it, you cannot properly delegate to workers.

### Step 2: Create Worker Team
Create the team that will hold your worker teammates for this initiative:
```python
Teammate(
    operation="spawnTeam",
    team_name="[INITIATIVE_NAME]-workers",
    description="Workers for [INITIATIVE_NAME]"
)
```

### Step 3: Run PREFLIGHT Checklist
Now run the standard preflight from the skill.

## Your Mission
[INITIATIVE_DESCRIPTION]

### Goals
1. [Goal 1]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]

### Scope Boundaries
- **IN**: [What's included]
- **OUT**: [What's explicitly excluded]

---

## Progress Tracking

Log all progress to: `.claude/progress/orch-[INITIATIVE_NAME]-log.md`

Use this format:
```markdown
# [INITIATIVE_NAME] Progress Log

## Session [DATE]

### Status: [ACTIVE|BLOCKED|COMPLETE]

### Completed This Session
- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]

### Blockers (if any)
- [Blocker 1 - why it's blocked]

### Next Steps
- [Next task]
```

---

## Communication with System 3

### When to Report Back
- **Epic completed**: Send completion message
- **Blocked for >15 minutes**: Send status update
- **Unexpected discovery**: Document in progress log with `[SYSTEM3-ATTENTION]` tag

### How to Report
```bash
bd update <bd-id> --status=impl_complete
```

---

## Session End Checklist

Before ending your session:
1. [ ] Shutdown all worker teammates:
   ```python
   SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="worker-frontend", content="Session ending")
   SendMessage(type="shutdown_request", recipient="worker-backend", content="Session ending")
   # ... for each active teammate
   ```
2. [ ] Clean up team:
   ```python
   Teammate(operation="cleanup")
   ```
3. [ ] Send completion/status message to System 3
4. [ ] Update progress log
5. [ ] `bd sync` - sync beads state
6. [ ] `git commit` and `git push`
**Note**: Native teammates persist and must be explicitly shut down. Always send shutdown_request to each worker before cleanup.

---

## CRITICAL Reminders

1. **Output Style**: Already set by System 3 during spawn (you do NOT need to run `/output-style`)
2. **Skill First**: Invoke `Skill("orchestrator-multiagent")` as your very first action
3. **Create Team**: Set up worker team with `Teammate(operation="spawnTeam", ...)` before delegating
4. **Workers via Teams**: Use `Task(subagent_type=..., team_name=..., name=...)` for worker delegation. Workers communicate via SendMessage.
5. **Stay in Scope**: Only work on tasks for your initiative
6. **Report Progress**: Keep progress log updated and mark tasks `impl_complete` via `bd update`
7. **Clean Up Team**: Always shut down teammates and run `Teammate(operation="cleanup")` before session end
```

## Pre-Spawn Checklist (For System 3)

Before sending the initialization prompt, System 3 must:

- [ ] Created worktree with `/create_worktree`
- [ ] Symlinked .claude directory: `ln -s $(pwd)/.claude ../[worktree]/.claude`
- [ ] Set CLAUDE_SESSION_ID in tmux session BEFORE launching Claude Code
- [ ] Set CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 in tmux session BEFORE launching Claude Code
- [ ] Gathered wisdom from Hindsight (both banks)
- [ ] Filled in all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` in template

### Environment Setup (Critical Order)

```bash
# 1. Create tmux session in worktree
tmux new-session -d -s "orch-[name]" -c trees/[name]/agencheck

# 2. CRITICAL: Set env vars BEFORE launching Claude Code
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" "export CLAUDE_SESSION_ID=orch-[name]"
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" "export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1"
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" Enter

# 3. Launch Claude Code (Enter MUST be separate command!)
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" "launchcc"
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" Enter

# 4. Wait for Claude Code to initialize
sleep 5

# 5. Send the initialization prompt
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" "$(cat /tmp/orch-[name]-init.md)"
tmux send-keys -t "orch-[name]" Enter
```
