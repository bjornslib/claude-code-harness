# Product Requirements Document: Workflow Matrix

**Product:** AgenCheck Workflow Matrix  
**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)  
**Date:** 15 January 2026  
**Author:** FAIE Labs  
**Status:** Draft for Extension

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Workflow Matrix enables AgenCheck customers to configure automated retry and channel fallback rules for agent communications. This feature addresses a critical customer need: ensuring verification contacts are reached through intelligent multi-channel retry logic, while allowing flexibility for different client requirements.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Background screening companies lose significant time and revenue when verification attempts fail due to unreachable contacts. Currently, retry logic is either manual (staff must remember to follow up) or rigidly programmed (no client-specific customisation). AgenCheck customers need:

1. Configurable retry rules that automate follow-up attempts
2. Channel fallback logic (e.g., try SMS if email fails)
3. Client-specific overrides for customers with unique requirements
4. Visibility into what rules are active and when they trigger

### 1.2 Solution Overview

A visual matrix interface allowing customers to:
- Define default retry workflows that apply to all clients
- Create client-specific overrides for individual end-customers
- Configure retry counts, intervals, and fallback channels per action
- View and restore historical workflow configurations
