## Message Sequence

### Message 1: First LinkedIn DM

{{PERSONALISED_CONTENT - 1-2 sentences max}}

---

[Pain points you've observed in the market - 3 bullets]

## 1-Sentence Personalization Pattern (MANDATORY)

**Pattern**: `"{fact}; {AI opportunity question}"`

### Guidelines:
- **Single Nugget Rule**: Pick ONE fact you're confident about
- **Personal Over Company**: Facts about THEM, not their employer
- **Make Them the Hero**: Position them as the person who could bring AI to life
- **Verifiable Only**: If you can't deduce it from their profile, don't include it

### Good Examples:
```
Noticed you describe yourself as [their own words]; what if AI could [domain-specific opportunity]?
```
```
Saw you're known for [reputation/skill]; what if AI could [opportunity aligned with that skill]?
```
```
Saw you took your [expertise] from [old context] to [new context]; what if AI could [opportunity relevant to journey]?
```

## Writing Style Guide

### Guidelines:

- Use semicolons to join related thoughts
- Say "I think" or "I reckon"
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- Use simple words
- Maintain professional executive tone
- Write as a peer, not a salesperson

---

## Key Rules

1. **Verified claims only** - Everything must be deducible from their profile
2. **Possibility language** - "I think an opportunity might be..."
3. **Specific references** - Always cite something from their profile
4. **Short personalisation** - 1-2 sentences max in Message 1
5. **Problem-first** - Lead with their challenge, not your pitch
