## Instructions

Extract the key technical concepts from this material. Focus on:

1. **Named APIs, classes, functions, or methods** (e.g., "GridSearchCV", "useState", "Pipeline")
2. **Design patterns or architectural concepts** (e.g., "Observer pattern", "microservices", "event sourcing")
3. **Technologies, frameworks, or libraries** (e.g., "WebSocket", "Redis", "PostgreSQL")
4. **Algorithms or data structures** (e.g., "B-tree", "quicksort", "hash map")
5. **Domain-specific terms** (e.g., "cross-validation", "tokenization", "dependency injection")

Rules:
- Extract only concepts that are explicitly present or strongly implied in the content
- Keep each concept as a short phrase (1-5 words)
- Aim for 5-50 concepts depending on material length
- Prefer specific concepts over generic ones (e.g., "GridSearchCV" over "search")
- Do not include common programming keywords (e.g., "if", "for", "class") unless they represent a named entity

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this format:
{
    "concepts": ["concept1", "concept2", "concept3"],
    "summary": "A one-sentence summary of what this reference material covers"
}

Do not include markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanatory text.
