You are a software architect. Plan the module decomposition for the following project.

## Project Name
{{ project_name }}

## Features
{% for feature in features %}
- {{ feature.name }}: {{ feature.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Instructions

Decompose the features into logical modules. For each module, specify:
1. **Module Name**: A descriptive name
2. **Responsibility**: What this module handles
3. **Components**: List of components within the module
4. **Dependencies**: Other modules this depends on

Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
