"""Engine-specific exception hierarchy.

All exceptions raised by the engine are subclasses of ``EngineError``.
This lets callers catch any engine error with a single except clause while
still being able to discriminate between specific error types.

Error taxonomy (from SD Section 7):

Fatal (exit non-zero, no automatic retry):
    ParseError          — already defined in parser.py; re-exported here
    ValidationError     — 13-rule validator (Epic 2); stub present
    UnknownShapeError   — node shape not in handler registry
    NoEdgeError         — EdgeSelector exhausted all 5 steps
    CheckpointVersionError — checkpoint schema_version mismatch

Recoverable on resume (checkpoint written before exit):
    HandlerError        — handler encountered unrecoverable error
    LoopDetectedError   — visit count exceeded max_retries (Epic 5 raises this)

Converted to HandlerError:
    TimeoutError        — CodergenHandler, ToolHandler, WaitHumanHandler timeouts
