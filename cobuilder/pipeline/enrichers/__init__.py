"""LLM enrichment pipeline for CoBuilder node graph processing.

This package implements a sequential enrichment pipeline where each enricher
makes LLM calls to append structured data to pipeline nodes.

Usage:
    from cobuilder.pipeline.enrichers import EnrichmentPipeline

    pipeline = EnrichmentPipeline()
    enriched_nodes = pipeline.enrich(nodes, repomap, sd)
