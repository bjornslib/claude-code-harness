# Chat Interface Visual Rendering

## Description

Validates that the AgenCheck chat interface renders correctly with proper styling, layout, and visual hierarchy. This visual test checks that all UI components are present, properly aligned, and styled according to the application design. Visual correctness is essential for user trust in a credential verification system.

## Steps

1. **Navigate** to `http://localhost:5001`
   - Expected: Page loads fully with no layout shifts or rendering delays

2. **Capture** screenshot of full page initial render
   - Target: `screenshots/01-full-page-render.png`
   - Expected: Screenshot saved showing the complete chat interface layout

3. **Assert** the page header/navigation bar is visible and properly styled
   - Target: `[data-testid="app-header"]` or header/nav element
   - Expected: Header is visible at the top of the page with application branding (AgenCheck logo or title), proper background color, and readable text

4. **Assert** the session sidebar/panel is visible
   - Target: `[data-testid="session-list"]` or sidebar/session panel
   - Expected: A sidebar or panel area for session management is visible on the left side (or designated position), with clear visual separation from the main chat area

5. **Assert** the main chat area occupies the primary content space
   - Target: `[data-testid="chat-area"]` or main chat container
   - Expected: Chat message area is the dominant visual element, with adequate width and height for conversation display

6. **Assert** the message input area is visible at the bottom of the chat area
   - Target: `[data-testid="message-input"]` or message input container
   - Expected: Input field is positioned at the bottom of the chat area, visually distinct with a border or background, and the send button is adjacent to it

7. **Capture** screenshot focused on the input area
   - Target: `screenshots/07-input-area-detail.png`
   - Expected: Screenshot saved showing the message input field and send button area

8. **Fill** the message input with "Visual rendering test message"
   - Target: `[data-testid="message-input"]` or message input textarea
   - Expected: Text appears in the input field with readable font and proper padding

9. **Assert** the input text is styled correctly
   - Expected: Text in the input field uses a legible font, appropriate size, and contrasts well with the input background

10. **Click** the Send button
    - Target: `[data-testid="send-button"]` or send button element
    - Expected: Message is sent and appears in the chat area

11. **Wait** for the user message bubble to render (timeout: 5s)
    - Expected: User message appears as a styled message bubble in the chat area

12. **Assert** the user message bubble is properly styled
    - Expected: User message bubble has:
      - Distinct background color differentiating it from assistant messages
      - Proper padding and border radius
      - Right-aligned or clearly identified as a user message
      - Readable text with appropriate font size

13. **Capture** screenshot of user message bubble styling
    - Target: `screenshots/13-user-message-styled.png`
    - Expected: Screenshot saved showing the styled user message bubble

14. **Wait** for assistant response (timeout: 30s)
    - Expected: Assistant response message bubble appears

15. **Assert** the assistant message bubble is visually distinct from user messages
    - Expected: Assistant message bubble has:
      - Different background color from user message bubbles
      - Left-aligned or clearly identified as an assistant message
      - Proper padding, border radius, and text styling
      - Sufficient contrast for readability

16. **Capture** screenshot of conversation with both message styles
    - Target: `screenshots/16-both-message-styles.png`
    - Expected: Screenshot saved showing user and assistant messages side by side with distinct styling

17. **Assert** no visual overflow or clipping issues
    - Expected: No text is cut off, no elements overflow their containers, and scrollbars appear only where expected (chat message area for long conversations)

18. **Assert** the page has no visible broken images or missing icons
    - Expected: All icons, images, and visual assets render correctly with no broken image placeholders

19. **Capture** screenshot of final complete state
    - Target: `screenshots/19-final-visual-state.png`
    - Expected: Screenshot saved showing the complete interface in its final state with all elements properly rendered
