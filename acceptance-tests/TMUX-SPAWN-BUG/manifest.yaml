    title: "exec zsh added to spawn sequence"
    weight: 0.40
    rationale: "Root cause fix — tmux defaults to bash, ccorch is a zsh function"

  - id: SPAWN-2
    title: "unset CLAUDECODE before ccorch"
    weight: 0.25
    rationale: "Prevents nested session error"

  - id: SPAWN-3
    title: "Wisdom injection via file reference"
    weight: 0.20
    rationale: "Markdown breaks tmux paste — file reference is the reliable pattern"

  - id: SPAWN-4
    title: "Complete 10-step sequence documented"
    weight: 0.15
    rationale: "All steps must be in correct order for reliable spawning"

# Weight verification: 0.40 + 0.25 + 0.20 + 0.15 = 1.00
